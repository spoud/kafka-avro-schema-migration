= AVRO Schema evolution - handling incompatible versions in Kafka consumers

AVRO Schemas evolve over time, but sometimes it is not possible to achieve backwards or forward compatibility of new schemas.

We demonstrate approaches to deal with such breaking changes using exemplary Spring Boot implementations.


== Option 1: inter-topic migration

[plantuml,opts=inline,format=svg]
----
@startuml

skinparam componentStyle rectangle
skinparam backgroundColor #f9f9f9
skinparam component {
    BackgroundColor<<producer>> #cfe2f3
    BackgroundColor<<consumer>> #d9ead3
    BackgroundColor<<service>> #fff2cc
    BorderColor Black
}

component "Producer V1" <<producer>>
component "Producer V2" <<producer>>
component "v1-topic"
component "Migration Service" <<service>>
component "v2-topic"
component "Consumer V2" <<consumer>>
component "Consumer V1" <<consumer>>

"Producer V1" --> "v1-topic" : writes v1 messages
"Producer V2" --> "v2-topic" : writes v2 messages
"v1-topic" --> "Migration Service" : reads
"Migration Service" --> "v2-topic" : writes v2 messages
"Consumer V2" --> "v2-topic" : reads
"Consumer V1" --> "v1-topic" : reads

In this pattern, the migration is done via a dedicated migration-service that reads v1 messages from a v1-topic, transforms them to the new format, and writes them to a v2-topic.

Eventually the V1-producer is replaced with a V2-producer.
The migration-service and v1-topic can then be deleted.

== Option 2: intra-topic migration with consumer logic

[plantuml,opts=inline,format=svg]
----
@startuml
skinparam componentStyle rectangle
skinparam backgroundColor #f9f9f9
skinparam component {
    BackgroundColor<<producer>> #cfe2f3
    BackgroundColor<<consumer>> #d9ead3
    BorderColor Black
}

component "Producer V1" <<producer>>
component "Producer V2" <<producer>>
component "shared-topic"
component "Consumer V2 \n(with v1 to v2 mapping logic)" <<consumer>> as consumer

"Producer V1" --> "shared-topic" : writes v1
"Producer V2" --> "shared-topic" : writes v2
consumer --> "shared-topic" : reads both

@enduml
----


Here, all schema versions are written to a single Kafka topic.
The consumer includes a custom deserializer with logic to handle both v1 and v2 formats during the migration.
V1 records are mapped to the new v2 schema in the deserializer.
Once v1 producers are deprecated, the additional consumer logic can be removed (i.e. switching back from the custom deserializer to the `KafkaAvroDeserializer`).

== Option 3: intra-topic migration with confluent schema contracts

[plantuml,opts=inline,format=svg]
----
@startuml
skinparam componentStyle rectangle
skinparam backgroundColor #f9f9f9
skinparam component {
    BackgroundColor<<producer>> #cfe2f3
    BackgroundColor<<consumer>> #d9ead3
    BackgroundColor<<registry>> #f4cccc
    BorderColor Black
}

component "Producer V1" <<producer>>
component "Producer V2" <<producer>>
component "shared-topic"
component "Consumer V2 \n(auto-mapping)" <<consumer>>
component "Schema Registry\n(with rules)" <<registry>>

"Producer V1" --> "shared-topic" : writes v1
"Producer V2" --> "shared-topic" : writes v2
"Consumer V2 \n(auto-mapping)" --> "shared-topic" : reads
"Consumer V2 \n(auto-mapping)" --> "Schema Registry\n(with rules)" : fetch schema + rules

@enduml

----

This approach uses Confluentâ€™s Schema Registry with custom migration rules (e.g., CEL and Jsonata).
Conceptionally this approach is similar to option 2, however the migration logic is not sotred directly in the consumer, but as part of the Schema inside the Schema Registry.
The consumer automatically fetches these migration rules and applies the schema transformations when is reads v1 messages. This enables seamless consumption of multiple versions.

To use this feature, either Confluent Platform (enterprise version) or Confluent Cloud are required.

See https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/fundamentals/data-contracts.html#custom-rules[the documentation for Confluent Schema Registry Data Contracts] for an in-depth explanation of how to use this feature.


== Schema Registry Configuration

The schema compatibility checks in Confluent Schema Registry prevent the registration of incompatible schemas.
As an alternative to temporarily setting the compatibility mode to None, you can also use the `compatibilityGroup` setting for the subject.

Add metadata with the major version:

[source,json]
.schema registration request payload
----
{
  "schema": "...",
  "metadata": {
    "properties": {
      "app.major.version": "2"
    }
  }
}
----

Configure the compatibility group

[source,bash]
.setting compatibility mode
----
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8081/config/my-subject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
  -d '{
    "compatibilityGroup": "app.major.version",
    "compatibility": "BACKWARD"
  }'
----

With this setup, schemas with the same `app.major.version` must be backward compatible.
Schemas with different major versions (e.g. 1 vs 2) can be incompatible, allowing controlled breaking changes.
